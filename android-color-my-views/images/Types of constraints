Types of constraints

Android Studio allows you to use the following types of constraints:

1. Fixed constraint: A constraint that is specified using a hard-coded number.
2. Adaptable constraint: A constraint that defines a relationship in relative and weighted terms.
3. Absolute positioning: A numerical positioning, such as the position in x, y coordinates.
4. Relative positioning: Views are positioned by specifying relationships with other views.
