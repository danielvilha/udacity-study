# Study Udacity

This project is for me to put everything I studied in this course: [Developing Android Apps with Kotlin by Google](https://www.udacity.com/course/developing-android-apps-with-kotlin--ud9012)


### My first app
I developed an app called "Dice Roller", where it is an application that I roll 6-sided dice.
